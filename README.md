# Counter

## The project counts from 0 to 50
## It has a add and reduce count button
## When count get to 0, on click of reduce button the program throws an alert "mininum value reached"
## If the count get to 50, on click of the add button the program throws an alert "maximum value reached"
## The count value is stored in localStorage to prevent loss of count value on refresh or restart
